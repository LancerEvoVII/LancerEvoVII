My name is Philipp and I'm a Beginner at Programming! 🐣

I want to learn as much as I can and am very passionate about doing so. 😺

## Current Focus
- Currently studying SQL and Databases! 💾
- Researching ERP Systems! 📈
- Working on my Letterboxd Data Scraper in Python 🎥
- Studying C++

## Future Plans
- Working on some Homebrew Apps for older consoles like the Wii or the OG Xbox! (HMU if you are a Homebrew Developer and need some help, I'd be glad to help and learn during the process! 🏠🍺)
