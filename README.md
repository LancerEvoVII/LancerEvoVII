Ух ты, вы нашли мой профиль! 🪆
My name is Philipp and I'm a Beginner at Programming! 🐣
I want to learn as much as I can and am very passionate about doing so. 😺
Current Focus: Making an Android App with Kotlin, trying out some JS and learning Assembly! Also trying to help out in some other Projects on here 🐸
Future Plans: Expanding on my (honestly very basic) Knowledge in Java and C# + using .NET to work on a Desktop App 🐍 I am also interested in working on some Homebrew Apps for older consoles like the Wii or the OG Xbox! HMU if you are a Homebrew Developer and need some help, I'd be glad to help and learn during the process! 🏠🍺
