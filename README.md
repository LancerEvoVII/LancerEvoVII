My name is Philipp and I'm a Beginner at Programming! 🐣

I want to learn as much as I can and am very passionate about doing so. 😺

## Current Focus
Making an Android App with Kotlin, trying out some JS and learning Assembly! Also trying to help out in some other Projects on here 🐸

## Future Plans
- Expanding on my (honestly very basic) Knowledge in Java and C# + using .NET to work on a Desktop App 🐍
- Working on some Homebrew Apps for older consoles like the Wii or the OG Xbox! (HMU if you are a Homebrew Developer and need some help, I'd be glad to help and learn during the process! 🏠🍺)
